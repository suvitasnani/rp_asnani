                            <li>Glyphosate is one of
                            the most popular herbicides
                            used worldwide and works by interrupting the shikimate pathway. Potassium nitrate is an
                            effective fertilizer and contains important plant nutrients, such as potassium and nitrogen.
                            This study aimed to see if potassium nitrate could reverse the effects of glyphosate. It was
                            hypothesized that the nitrate content in a moderate amount of potassium nitrate would
                            overcome the effects of glyphosate by allowing the shikimate pathway to function properly
                            again and produce essential amino acids in Rapid-cycling Brassica rapa. The study was
                            conducted by growing 5 groups of 10 Rapid-cycling Brassica rapa and splitting them up. One
                            group was set as a positive control, only being treated with distilled water, and another
                            group was set as a negative control, being treated with both distilled water and glyphosate.
                            The other three groups had glyphosate applied to them as well as varying concentrations of
                            potassium nitrate solutions, with a low concentration (2 g/L), medium concentration (5 g/L),
                            and a high concentration (20 g/L). The length of the plants before and after one week of
                            experimentation is recorded, along with the dry biomass. An ANOVA Statistical Test was run
                            on the change in lengths, and T-tests were run on the data after the ANOVA came back
                            statistically significant. The data supported the hypothesis, as the length of plants in
                            medium and high concentrations of potassium nitrate was statistically significantly longer
                            compared to the negative control. Further, the length of the plants in the high
                            concentration had no statistically significant growth as compared to the positive control,
                            showing that they were similar values. It was found that a moderate or high concentration of
                            potassium nitrate may be able to reverse the effects of glyphosate. </li>

                                    While being used, glyphosate can
                                    accidentally be introduced to crops. Some crops
                                    are engineered to be resistant to glyphosate, allowing farmers to
                                    spray their entire field without worrying about it affecting their crops.
                                    However, not all crops are genetically engineered. It is known
                                    that potassium nitrate has a beneficial effect on plants when used in
                                    moderate amounts. If a plant is accidentally introduced to glyphosate, it
                                    could die. If it was known that something, in this case, potassium nitrate,
                                    could overcome glyphotate, plants could be saved from dying.
