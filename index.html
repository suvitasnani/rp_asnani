                            <li>This study aimed to see if potassium nitrate could reverse the effects of glyphosate in
                                case of an accident </li>
                            <li>It was hypothesized that the nitrate content in a moderate amount of potassium nitrate
                                would
                                overcome the effects of glyphosate by allowing the shikimate pathway to function

                                again in Rapid-cycling <em>Brassica rapa</em></li>
                            <li>The study was conducted by growing 50 Rapid-cycling <em>Brassica rapa</em> and
                                splitting them up into 5 groups of 10</li>
                            <li>There was one positive control, one negative control, and 3 experimental groups (low,
                                medium, and high concentration solutions)</li>
                            <li>The length of the plants before and after one week of experimentation was recorded,
                                along
                                with the dry biomass</li>
                            <li>An ANOVA Statistical Test was run on the change in lengths, and T-tests were run on the
                                data after the ANOVA came back
                                statistically significant</li>
                            <li>The data supported the hypothesis, as the length of plants in
                                medium and high concentrations of potassium nitrate was statistically significantly
                                longer
                                compared to the negative control</li>
                            <li>Further, the length of the plants in the high
                                concentration had no statistically significant growth as compared to the positive
                                control,
                                showing that they were similar values</li>
                            <li>It was found that a moderate or high
                                concentration of potassium nitrate may be able to reverse the effects of glyphosate</li>

                                    Glyphosate is one of the most popular herbicides used worldwide and works by
                                    interrupting the shikimate pathway. Glyphosate inhibits an enzyme from working
                                    correctly in a plant, stopping production of essential amino acids and killing the
                                    plant. <br><br> Potassium nitrate is an effective fertilizer and
                                    contains important plant nutrients. Both potassium and nitrate have been found to be
                                    beneficial to plants in a moderate quanitity.<br><br> Finally, little is known about
                                    the effect of other introduced chemicals, specifically potassium nitrate, on the
                                    effect of glyphosate and its growth on plants.

                                    While being used, glyphosate can
                                    accidentally be introduced to crops. Some crops
                                    are engineered to be resistant to glyphosate, allowing farmers to
                                    spray their entire field without worrying about it affecting their crops.
                                    However, not all crops are genetically engineered. It is known
                                    that potassium nitrate has a beneficial effect on plants when used in
                                    moderate amounts. If a plant is accidentally introduced to glyphosate, it
                                    could die. If it was known that something, in this case, potassium nitrate,
                                    could overcome glyphotate, plants could be saved from dying. This study aimed to see
                                    if potassium nitrate could reverse the effects of glyphosate
                                    to save crops from dying in case of accidents.
