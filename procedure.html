                                                collected by measuring the length from the soil, where the base of the
                                                stem was, to the highest point of the plant. This was performed on each
                                                plant and data was recorded. Dry biomass was collected by carefully
                                                removing each plant from its pot.
                                                Plants were removed gently and slowly so no part of the plant was ripped
                                                off and could alter the results. A paintbrush was used to remove any
                                                soil. Plants were put in a laboratory oven in foil to dry them out and
                                                to get
                                                the proper conditions for measuring dry biomass. Plants were put in the
                                                oven for 22 hours at 110°C. Using the Mettler Toledo AE163 Analytical
                                                Balance, each plant’s dry biomass was recorded.

                                                each other, and the groups that had a statistical difference were noted.
